Dijkstra’s (Shortest Path) Algorithm

— acts upon a graph and makes use of a priority queue (binary heap)
— specifically weighted graphs

— many tech companies ‘add their own flavor’ to Dijkstra’s

### Find the shortest path between two vertices on a graph ###

GPS, Network routing, Airline tickets, Biology — model the spread of viruses among humans (lol)

Writing a weighted graph:
— updated addEdge method to create an object ({ node: ‘A’, weight: 10 }) that is added onto the adjacency list

Simple priority queue 
- O (nlogn), makes use of .sort() when enqueueing a value
