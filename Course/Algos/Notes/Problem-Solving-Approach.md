Problem Solving Approach

What is an Algorithm?
 - a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

	1.	Devise a plan for solving problems
	2.	Master common problem solving patterns

Understand the problem
	⁃	Can I restate the problem in my own words?
	⁃	What are the inputs that go into the problem?
	⁃	What do you expect the output to be?
	⁃	Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
	⁃	How should I label the important pieces of the data?

Concrete Examples
	⁃	Com up with examples to help you understand the problem better
	⁃	Provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
	⁃	Real world examples: user stories, unit tests
	⁃	Simple examples
	⁃	Progress to more complex examples
	⁃	Edge Cases
	⁃	Empty inputs
	⁃	Invalid inputs

Break it down
	⁃	Explicitly write out the steps you take // pseudocode // talk through your solution
	⁃	Examples
	⁃	Prodding the interviewer for more information, ask clarifying questions in this step
	⁃	Write out steps (words > code) 

Solve or simplify
	⁃	When there’s a thing or two difficult parts to the problem you don’t understand, simplify it. Don’t ignore it. 

If you can get 90% of the way to the solution and identify the last 10% with possible solutions it is still a successful attempt. 

Look back and refactor
	⁃	Important to strive for the most efficient code, missed opportunity.
	⁃	Scrappy code. Code that works is the big goal but there needs to be a balance. 


Good to return to your solution and discuss the performance of your solution (time and space complexity, bigO)
What are other approaches for this problem? What did I miss? How did others solve this? Pick the interviewers brain. 


aside: 
regex alphanumeric check  // if (/a-z0-9/.test(element)) { } // slower than charCode
.charCodeAt()
